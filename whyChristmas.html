			<p>
				Jesus Christ is a very important person because he's kind of like the son of God and all that. He had this boy band that had 12 members that were like "believe in God btw". He invented being nice when everyone wasn't being nice a long time ago. But then the not nice people were like "wtf ur not the Son of God" and He's like "I keep it 100 bro no cappin" but they weren't really convinced so they beat him up bad.<br>
