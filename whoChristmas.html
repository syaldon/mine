			<p>
				Holidays and ceremonies are important for the human psyche. Entertainment and temporal contentment is part of what humans need. Without a bit of fun and laying low, humans won't really function that well. That was a really unnescessary briefing to the part of the "Hiearchy of Needs" that covers temporal contentment. Anyways, Christians really like Jesus Christ. He's like the mascot of Christianity (sorry Holy Spirit maybe you should've been consistent with what you were supposed to look like). Outside of the part where we honor Jesus, Christmas is celebrated so we can have a bit of a retreat from what has happened all throughout the year, because there surely has been alot. It's like a really bad season finale because everyone just starts being nice. It would've been bad in a tv show but I think it's really good for us. Conflicts aren't really the most fun thing to deal with. A season to unwind and just bond with lovedones is important and Christmas is the embodiment of what that is. Christmas transcends religion, as non-traditional Christians or even non-Christians celebrate it. It might be some kind of a sign of respect towards Christians, or Christians not excluding anyone in their most important holiday. Either way, everyone is happy, and I hope you are too. Merry Christmas!<br>
