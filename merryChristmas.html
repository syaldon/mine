			<p>My name is Carl Angelo Aldon, I am a student of Computer Engineer in De La Salle University. 
			I am 18 years old. I was born in May 21, 2000. I really like Christmas because its cold and I hope I dont get mugged by some dude who is just aiming to provide for his family in Christmas time. I think capitalism is kinda bad<br>
