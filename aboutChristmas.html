			<p>
				Christmas is all about love and caring. Christmas was invented when this Dude named Jesus was born. He was so cool he invited everyone to his birthday party. In fact, Filipinos thought "Jesus is so cool, maybe we should start preparing for His birthday MONTHS before it actually is!" And so people started making songs and selling things so people can celebrate His birthday. Cool huh?<br>
