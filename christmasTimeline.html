			<p>
				Christmas is so cool it's being prepared for 3 months in advance. Except theres a huge 1 month hole in this preparation perion to give way for Halloween. It's really funny how that works.<br>

					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">January</font></td>
						<td>New Year is basically Christmas 2. Christmas decorations of last year are still up.
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">April</font></td>
						<td>It's summer! There are no Christmas decorations around anymore because its really hot.
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">May</font></td>
						<td>Okay let's be real who cares about May. It's the worst month ever. The best thing that happens in May is probably the labor day thing on its first day and that's it. Literally absolutely nothing is happening in May besides providing dread towards students who are approaching another school year. May sucks.
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">June</font></td>
						<td>It's school time. Atleast for the majority of people. I think that has completely chanegd nowadays I dont really know La Salle has a weird calendar for me to care.

					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">October</font></td>
						<td>Ok pause the Christmas thing we have to celebrate Halloween. Everyone loves Halloween because you can dress up as your favorite Power Ranger without being looked at weird.
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">November</font></td>
						<td>Personally I get into a really bad mood whenever Nov. 1 or 2 hits a weekend it just feels so unfortunate. Other than that, resume Christmas preparations.
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><font size="5" color="black">December</font></td>
						<td>Alright it's Christmas, time to tell your loved ones how important and how you appreciate them by giving them gifts and telling them you love them! Merry Christmas!!!!!!!!!
